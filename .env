NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
#This is a limitation of Node.js. The certificate check can be disabled by setting the env NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to something falsey (e.g. "0") but this is strongly discouraged for production use. There's no easy way to disable these checks per server and it's strongly discouraged to disable these checks ever.It is recommend either using HTTP over an SSH tunnel or using a real certificate (via letsencrypt).
